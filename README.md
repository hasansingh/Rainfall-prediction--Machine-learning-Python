# Rainfall-prediction--Machine-learning-Python
Rainfall Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach:
	Data Import and Preparation: Imported and preprocessed the rainfall dataset, ensuring data integrity and analysis readiness.
	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA to reveal trends and correlations, using visualizations to clarify data distributions.
	Model Development: Developed various Classification models and fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve performance and accuracy.
	Model Evaluation: Evaluated performance with key metrics, including accuracy score, confusion matrix.
	Best Model Selection: Selected the top-performing classification model to optimize rainfall forecasting predictions.
